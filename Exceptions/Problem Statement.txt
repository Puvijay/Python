the power of a number. This method takes two integers, and, as parameters and finds. If either or is 
negative, then the method must throw an exception which says “n or p should not be negative ". Also, 
if both and are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says " n or p should not be Zero” 
For example, -4 and -5 would result in “Exception : n or p should not be negative” Complete 
the function power in class MyCalculator and return the appropriate result after the power operation 
or an appropriate exception as detailed above.
